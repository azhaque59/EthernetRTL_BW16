EthernetRTL_BW16
=================

Work-in-progress Arduino library for Ai-Thinker BW16 (RTL8720DN) + WIZnet W5500 Ethernet module.

Purpose:
This library provides a compile-verified stub and driver integration layer for the
WIZnet ioLibrary_Driver (W5500) adapted to the Realtek Ameba-D / Ai-Thinker BW16 platform.

Version 1.0.0: Compilation verified only (no hardware test yet).

Installation:
1. Extract this folder into Documents\Arduino\libraries\EthernetRTL_BW16
2. Restart Arduino IDE.
3. Open File -> Examples -> EthernetRTL_BW16 -> W5500_TestCompile
4. Compile to verify successful header linkage.

Next Steps (To DO):
- Connect BW16 to W5500 via SPI.
- Validate link and test basic ping.
- Publish schematic and hardware setup.

Roadmap:
v1.0.0  Compile verified only (this release)
v1.1.0  Hardware validated (ping verified)
v1.2.0  Full Wi-Fi â†” Ethernet bridge
